  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I am a BCom Graduate eagerly awaiting my official mark sheet after completing my exams in July this year. <br />
  Alongside my academic pursuits, I have also dedicated myself to expanding my skill set.<br />
  I completed a certified Tally Course with GST, enhancing my knowledge of finance and taxation.<br />
  Additionally, I am a proud graduate of the Freedom Employability Academy (FEA), where I honed my Employability Skills, Professional Communications, and various Computational Skills like email writing.
</p>

<p>
  To further develop my expertise, I am currently undertaking a Web Development certified course from Udemy, eager to delve in the realm of coding and website creation.<br />
  My academic journey includes completing my 10th from CMS, focussing on Commerce, Mathematics, and Computer Applications where I studied <b>JAVA programming</b> as part of my curriculum.This exposure to JAVA provided me with a foundation in object-oriented programming and problem-solving skills.<br />
  Subsequently, I pursued my 12th grade at BVM, specializing in Commerce and Computer Science, where I studied <b>Python programming</b> as part of my curriculum. Python broadened my understanding of programming concepts and enhanced my analytical thinking capabilities.
</p>

<p>
  These programming languages, JAVA and Python served as subsets to my overall computer studies, enriching my skill set in software development, logical reasoning, and algorithmic thinking.<br />
  I am enthusiastic about applying these skills to real-world scenarios, embracing challenges, and contributing effectively to projects that demand innovative solutions and a collaborative approach.<br />
  I am eager to continue learning and growing both personally and professionally  while adding value to any team that values dedication, creativity, and continuous improvement.
